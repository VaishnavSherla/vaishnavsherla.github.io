Hello, and welcome to my very first blog post! I am Vaishnav, a student pursuing my BE in CSE at CBIT, Hyderabad.

The main focus of this blog will be on tech-related topics. I believe in the phrase, 
> If you can't explain it in simple terms, you don't understand it.` 

This belief inspired me to start this blog.

So, what can you expect from my blog? Well, I'll be sharing articles primarily focused on web technologies. I'll also be providing some insights into Ethical Hacking. Additionally, I'll be exploring things that I find exciting and important. I'll write about it on the blog if it matters to me.

If you're following my blog, I hope you find it useful! If time permits, I aim to publish at least one to two posts a week.

If you have any improvements, comments, or constructive criticisms, contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaishnav-sherla/).
